## Situation
The customer has an orderbook review with the program manager on a weekly basis. I was tasked to update the current report weekly (Phase 1) and share it with the program manager.
I found the report design not structured and the main visual show data already present in a PowerBI dashboard accessible by the program manager had already access to. When I first updated the report, I found it confusing on where to add the new data plus the graphs weren't updated automatically.

## Task
I set myself to find a way to make the report easier to navigate, quicker to be updated, reduce the number of tabs and make visuals more appealing.  

## Action
I started to group all table required to create the three graphs into one tab, give a title to the tab and on top of sheet. I keep the attributes originally used and set them as a table so my visuals will be updated automatically when I change the data. I kept the same principle for the second tab “OrderBook” and the third tab “Dashboard”. The colour theme used are mainly colours used on the customer logo.

## Result
My amendments allows me to update this report within 20min instead of 30-40min and the program manager as well as the customer were able to have a clearer view of the current open orderbook status.
Further improvements can be done with more automation with the dashboard tables and  the addition of a message on selected cells to inform where the data should come from would be helpful in case another analyst has to cover me. This is nevertheless not requested by the business so I will only work on this improvement whenever I have some spare working times.
